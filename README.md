# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer

This project implements a comparison visualizer for several sorting algorithms using Pythons Tkinter library for GUI and matplotlib for plotting the performance. This allows the user to select different algorithms, set the size of the input, view the results and saves the unsorted and sorted arrays.

# Prerequisites

*Python version 3.11.5 | packaged by Anaconda Inc
*Matplotlib version 3.7.2

# Run the program

*Start the application after downloading or cloning repo
*Select number of algorithms
*Enter array size
*Click sort button

# Files

Unsorted and sorted text files are generated every time sorting is performed and are named according to algorithm and size of array.
